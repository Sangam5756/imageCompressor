Sometimes, websites or apps require images (like profile photos, ID proofs, or documents) to be **under a specific file size**—for example, under 200KB.

- 📸 Mobile users often upload large photos directly from their camera.
- 📄 Some government or form portals have strict size limits.
- 🚀 Large images can slow down websites and use more server space.

This tool helps by **reducing file size while keeping the image clear**, making it easy to upload and use anywhere.

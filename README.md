A fast and easy-to-use **online image compressor** that reduces image size without significant quality loss. Ideal for uploading course banners, profile images, documents, or web assets with strict file size limits.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

During my internship, I worked on a **course-selling platform** where we regularly uploaded **banner images** for courses and lectures.

These images were usually **4–5MB**, which made **loading times slow** and caused performance issues on both the admin panel and the frontend. We needed a way to reduce file size **without compromising quality**—especially for multiple image uploads.

This tool was built to solve that problem. It helped us compress images from 3MB down to as low as **50–60KB** while still looking great.

## ❓ What Problem Does It Solve?

Web platforms often require images to be below a certain size (e.g., 200KB), but most images taken from cameras or phones are much larger.

- 📸 Users upload large raw images.
- 📄 Government forms or portals reject oversized files.
- 🖥️ Admin dashboards and websites become slow with large assets.
- 📡 Bandwidth usage increases on mobile devices and low-speed networks.
